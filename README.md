## Why?

An easy to use, visual library for my record collection. The idea started simply. I just wanted something to choose a record to play for me at random. Then I realized it had more potential. A boring spreadsheet could be upgraded to a much nicer UI that I can input info about my collection into and track the state of my collection.

## Uses:  
Typescript with Vue  
Discogs API  
Firebase realtime database


## Goals:
- ~~A nice visual library of what I have~~
- ~~All the details for my collection (condition - rating and notes)~~
- ~~Random album selection ("roulette") to help me listen to as many records as I can~~
- ~~Automatic collections ('thumbs up', 'thumbs down', unplayed)~~
- Custom collections ('Disco', 'Hip Hop/Rap', 'Driving music')
- Can query specific info (such as # of records that need replacement jackets) that might be helpful for improving my collection (buying however many jackets are needed)
- New records can be added through UI
- Custom settings (color choices, dark mode?)
